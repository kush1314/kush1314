## Hi there 👋

I’m Kush! I’m currently studying **Computer Science & Economics** with a **minor in Statistics** at **UIUC**.  
I enjoy building full-stack applications, working with data, and exploring how software and AI can solve real-world problems.

You’ll usually find me working on projects involving backend systems, modern web frameworks, or data-driven tools. Always learning, always building 🚀
